Backtracking Algorithm for N-Queens:
The backtracking approach can be described as follows:

Start by placing the first queen in the first row and try all columns in the first row.
For each column in the first row, check if it's safe to place the queen:
No other queen is placed in the same column.
No other queen is placed on the same diagonal.
If a safe spot is found, recursively move to the next row and repeat the process.
If a queen cannot be placed in any column of a row, backtrack by removing the queen from the previous row and trying the next column.
Once a solution is found (all queens placed), store the solution.
Continue until all possible solutions are found.



The N-Queens Problem is a classic example of a backtracking problem in computer science and artificial intelligence. It is often used to teach and understand the concepts of constraint satisfaction problems, recursion, and backtracking.

Problem Definition:
The N-Queens Problem asks: "How can you place N queens on an N Ã— N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other?"

A queen in chess can attack another queen if they are placed in the same row, column, or diagonal. Therefore, the goal is to arrange the N queens on the chessboard in such a way that no two queens can attack each other.

Key Concepts:
Constraints:

No two queens can share the same row.
No two queens can share the same column.
No two queens can be on the same diagonal (both principal and secondary diagonals).
Backtracking: The N-Queens problem is often solved using backtracking, which involves exploring all possible placements of queens on the board. If a placement leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks to the previous placement and tries a new possibility.


The time complexity for solving the N-Queens problem using the backtracking approach is generally O(N!), because for each queen, we have to try placing it in N possible positions, and for each row, we recursively try all valid configurations.


Advantages of N-Queens Problem:
Helps Understand Backtracking: A good demonstration of the backtracking technique.
Efficient Use of Constraints: Teaches how to use constraints to reduce solution space.
Scalable Solutions: Can be adapted to larger sizes with optimizations.
Encourages Recursive Thinking: Enhances problem-solving skills through recursive approaches.

Disadvantages of N-Queens Problem:
Time Complexity: Backtracking solution has high time complexity (O(N!)).
Memory Intensive: Large board sizes can consume significant memory.
Inefficient for Large N: Slow for large values of N without further optimizations.
Limited Real-World Application: Mostly theoretical; doesn't have direct application in most real-world problems.

Applications of N-Queens Problem:
Constraint Satisfaction Problems: Demonstrates solving problems with constraints.
Game AI: Used in puzzle solving and game state validation.
Optimization Algorithms: Helps in understanding how to approach optimization problems.
Scheduling Problems: Similar approach used in scheduling tasks with constraints.
